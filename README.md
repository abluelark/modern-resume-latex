### Adding your own photo
* create a folder named **Resources**
* place your photo within this folder
* edit the .tex document appropriately to match your image file name

### Layout
* The .tex document reads left to right, top to bottom.
* Play around with the ```\vspace{}``` paramaters to fit the page correctly.
